# Running Slurm Jobs on SciNet Niagara #
## Getting Set Up ##

Now that you know a bit about how the Kimel Lab Slurm cluster works (if not see [here](https://github.com/TIGRLab/TIGRSlurm-Docs/blob/master/README.md)), we can discuss some of the differences between the local lab cluster and the SciNet Niagara cluster.

All of our publically available datasets are processed, archived, and stored on SciNet. You will do all of your computing on SciNet for all of the following studies:

- HBN (Healthy Brain Network dataset)
- HCP (Human Connectome Project dataset)
- PNC (*The something something something dataset Jerry what is this?*)
- POND (Province of Ontario NeuroDevelopmental dataset)
